# This script implements a Layer-2 Data Enrichment service: it connects to an MQTT broker, listens to two topics (device logs and network/auth logs), and enriches 
# incoming messages by calling functions in the enricher module that query a DatabaseConnector.

# Uses Paho MQTT callbacks (on_connect, on_message) to subscribe and process messages asynchronously; enriched events are printed as pretty JSON.

# Reads configuration from config.ini, opens a DB connection, and performs graceful shutdown / cleanup in a finally block.

# Includes a small sys.path hack at the module entrypoint so the package-relative imports (..utils.db_connector) work when the file is executed as __main__.
