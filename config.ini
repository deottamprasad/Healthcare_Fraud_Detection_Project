#This configuration file supplies MQTT connection details (broker address, port, and two topic names) and PostgreSQL connection 
#credentials (host, port, database, user, password) that your application will read at runtime.
#For containerized setups, replace localhost with the service names (mosquitto, postgres) so internal Docker networking works, 
#and move sensitive items (like PASSWORD) into environment variables or a secrets manager for production.
